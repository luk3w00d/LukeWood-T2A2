## Vehicle service tracker

I have created this app to help track older classic cars service and cost history as they often do not have any kind way to track when certain services had been completed. With this app it is possible to track and also leave notes about what has been done and what is nearly due to be serviced.

As many classic cars are increasing in value being able to track all maintenance and cost makes it easier to show potential new owners what has been done recently and how much was spent doing the maintenance, But being able to assess this while out ordering parts makes alot easier.
